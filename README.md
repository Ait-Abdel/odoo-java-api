Odoo Java Api
================

A Java API to connect to Odoo and manage data using the XMLRPC interface.

The API reduces the amount of boiler plate code needed to communicate with Odoo by doing error checking and type conversions.
For more information, including a Wiki please see the project on SourceForge: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/openerpjavaapi/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openerpjavaapi)

=======
The Api IS known to work perfectly :
* openerp-java-api-1.3.0 works perfectly up to OpenERP v7 (Branch 7.0 - no more supported)
* openerp-java-api-2.0.x is supposed to work with the new API introduced in odoo v8  (branch upto9)
** Take care, the package name have replace openerp by odoo so that compatibility is broken
* openerp-java-api-3.0.x , package renamed, tested on Odoo v10
** purposed is to be pushed on maven for pentaho integration
